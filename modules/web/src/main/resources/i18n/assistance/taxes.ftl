Can you Declare $N for My Order to Avoid Import Taxes?
"Can you help me by declaring the goods at VERY LOW VALUE ?"

First, we will do our best to help you with import regulations.

If you have special instructions for the waybill and invoice declaration on your orders, you need to tell us these instructions every time you order, using the online checkout comments box. One such example is instructing us to declare the value below a certain value.


"Can we always declare low? Like, under $30?"

we are really sorry we can not. because your order value may be much higher than this and declaring that low value would not be feasible.

Provided the value of your order / type/ quantity of the items is suitable for a declaration under $100, we will do our best to help you with this.

If you need advice about whether a particular declared value is deemed possible, before you pay, you can check out an order and submit a ticket with your order number. We will then look at the contents of your order and your country and assess what declared value is sensible
Why I was Asked for "CPF" Number? (Brazil Customers)
Our customers in Brazil have informed us that companies importing anything to Brazil are supposed to state their "CNPJ" number, and individuals are supposed to state their "CPF" number on invoices.

So if you want us to ship your order to Brazil, please make sure you give us the correct "CNPJ" or "CPF" number, so the package can go through customs smoothly.

How much tax do I need to pay
Please note that all import taxes / duties are the buyer’s responsibility.

Banggood.com will accept no responsibility for customs costs incurred.

Many countries do not charge import duties on private items, samples, and goods below a certain stated value.

However, you may find that you have to pay taxes when goods you’ve ordered from us arrive in your country.

Obviously you will want this to be as low as possible, but Banggood CANNOT give you advice or information about tax rates and customs charges in your country.

You must ensure you find out about regulations in your own country before ordering from Banggood.com. In most countries the actual origin of the goods (China) is not important: only the declared value of the goods and declared contents is relevant.

Let us know if you have any special packing or labeling instructions when placing your order.
Taxes on imported goods
We don't add taxes, VAT, or other hidden charges. You pay what you see on the checkout page, i.e. goods subtotal + shipping cost.

However, in most countries in the world you have to pay taxes on imported goods. Sometimes goods under a certain value, or in certain categories, do not incur taxes.
The rules are different in every country.

In any one country the rules are often applied differently in different places, and sometimes rather randomly.

Banggood is based in China. We are a Chinese company. Therefore anything you buy from us is going to be imported as far as your country's customs are concerned.

Unfortunately there is no way for us to know the rules, regulations, customs, traditions, practices, loopholes, schemes, systems, paperwork, codes, laws, or rulings of any country.

As such we cannot, and will not, offer advice about taxes in your country.

As the buyer, it is your responsibility to find out that information before you order.

If you have to pay import taxes and/or additional duties and sales taxes (e.g. VAT in the UK) then you would have to pay that to the courier upon receipt of the package(s) from China. Unfortunately we can't calculate this for you and there is no way to pre-pay it. If you are drop-shipping or sending a gift item to someone else please make sure they are aware of the possibility of having to pay taxes when receiving the goods.

If you order goods from us and feel that you've been unexpectedly 'stung' with taxes at your end, please understand.

Please find out as much as you can about your import taxes in your own country before completing your order.

If you find out information about the import tax situation in your country, and you believe there are ways for you to minimize the taxes you have to pay (or eliminate the taxes altogether), we are more than happy to follow your instructions regarding labeling, packing, declarations, invoices, etc. Just tell us what you need and we will let you know what we can do to help.
